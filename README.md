# TTIM_v3_firmware
Firmware and scripts for TTIM version 3

To compile the HDLs, use Vivado to create a project with FPGA "XC7K325TFFG-900" selected. Then add all the files in /sources to the project and run "generate bitstream". 
The IPs were generated with Vivado 2018.1, please use version 2018.1 or higher version.

The /scripts has its own readme file.
